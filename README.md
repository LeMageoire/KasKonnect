# Context
2nd Year project at the HEIG-VD for the multidisciplinary project.
We were in a group of 3 people but I were responsible of the whole app programming.
## Goal
The goal was to build a mobile (Android) app that could exchange location data using bluetooth to exchange data with a microcontrolleur using bluetooth on a bike helmet 
## How to do
### Part 1 : Mobile App
- the mobile app uses google API to collect GCS data (Geographic coordinate system) as latitude and longitude of our actual position and the target position selected by the user
- using the mobile sensor, we can define the user orientation in space
### Part 2 : the micro controller
- we send the instruction to drive the led
### Results
- notes of 6.0 / 6.0 on the project
